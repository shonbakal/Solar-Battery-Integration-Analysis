# Solar Battery Integration Analysis

## Project Overview

This project aims to assess the potential benefits of integrating a battery storage system with existing solar panels for residential properties. The analysis utilizes data from the year 2023 to explore electricity usage patterns, solar energy generation, and potential cost savings.

### Objective

To evaluate the financial and operational advantages of adding a battery storage system to an existing solar energy setup.

### Scope

The analysis covers:
- Cost savings
- Battery performance
- Long-term financial viability
- Environmental impact

The data analyzed is from the year 2023.

## Key Findings

### Solar Generation vs. Electricity Usage

- **Solar Generation:** Peaks between 10 AM and 2 PM.
- **Electricity Usage:** Peaks in the evening.

### Potential Savings

- **Cost Savings:** Installing the battery system would have saved $16,752.22 in 2023.

### Battery Performance

- **Capacity:** The 12.5 kWh battery effectively stored excess solar energy and reduced reliance on the grid.
- **Monthly Impact:** Visualizations demonstrate a reduction in purchased electricity.

### Long-term Financial Analysis

- **Government Scenario (4% annual increase):**
  - Net Present Value (NPV): $5,451.32
  - Internal Rate of Return (IRR): 14.13%
- **Naomi's Scenario (4% + 0.25% annual increase):**
  - NPV: $9,312.72
  - IRR: 16.80%

## Implications

### Financial Viability

The investment in a battery system is financially viable, with better outcomes in scenarios with higher electricity price increases.

### Energy Independence

The system reduces dependence on the grid and provides protection against future price hikes.

### Environmental Impact

Enhanced utilization of solar energy and decreased grid reliance contribute to a reduced carbon footprint.

## Recommendations

- Proceed with the installation of the battery system.
- Monitor the system's performance after installation.
- Consider expanding the solar panel system if electricity prices rise more rapidly than expected.

## Limitations and Further Study

### Limitations

- The analysis is based on 2023 data, which may not reflect long-term trends.
- Assumes a consistent rate of electricity price increases.

### Further Study

- Analyze data spanning multiple years.
- Conduct sensitivity analyses with varying electricity price scenarios.

## Conclusion

Integrating a battery storage system is financially beneficial, providing substantial cost savings, enhanced energy independence, and contributing to environmental sustainability.
